Hashmap: The pattern where we can store the key and value.
Key must be unique.
value can differ the 

Why we use Hashmap::
1. When a given array is asked for many number of times at that time we can use the Hashmap isntead of array
2. when the one value is unique and thenwe can change the value accordingly .



Hashmap-->pres-storing-->fetching

#####################
can we declare the maximum size of array 10^9 +1????
no....the maximum size of array whcih we can delcare is the 10^6. if we declare larger than that,
it will show you segmentattion fault.


size            scope           bool
10^6            local           10^7
10^7            global          10^8




to hash the char we can use the index as char-'a'. i.e, arr[char-'a']++;


time complexity:
ordered-map::
pre-store=O(logN).  {best, average, worst}
fetching=O(logN)     {best, average, worst}
unordered-map:: in unordered map, the order is not defined 
pre-store== O(1). {best, average} O(N) {worst }
fetching=O(1){{best, average}} O(N){worst}
N is the number of elements in array



Hashing work flow:  1.Division method
                    2. Folding method
                    3. Mid Square method
